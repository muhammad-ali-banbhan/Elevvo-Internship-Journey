Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis
========================================

Project Requirements:
---------------------
- Dataset: Online Retail Dataset (UCI)
- Analyze customer behavior based on:
  - Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase
  - Frequency: How often they made purchases
  - Monetary: How much money they spent
- Assign scores to each customer using these three metrics
- Group similar customers based on their scores
- Suggest simple marketing ideas for each group
- Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Seaborn (or Excel)
- Covered Topics: Feature Engineering | Segmentation Logic | Customer Analytics
- Bonus: Visualize RFM segments with heatmaps or bar charts

------------------------------------------------------------

What We Did:
============

Step 1A: Data Exploration
-------------------------
- Imported the dataset and checked shape, columns, and sample rows.
- Verified missing values and dataset information.

Step 1B: Data Cleaning & Outlier Detection
------------------------------------------
- Removed missing values (CustomerID, InvoiceNo, Description).
- Removed negative or cancelled transactions.
- Created a new feature: TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice.
- Detected outliers using boxplots.
- Saved cleaned dataset.

Step 2: Data Summary Report
---------------------------
- Created summary table including:
  * Total Transactions: 392692
  * Unique Customers: 4338
  * Unique Products: 3665
  * Unique Countries: 37
  * Date Range: 2010-12-01 → 2011-12-09
  * Avg Quantity per Order: 13.12
  * Avg Unit Price: 3.13
  * Avg Total Price per Transaction: 22.63
  * Max Transaction Value: 168469.6

Step 3: RFM Metrics Calculation
-------------------------------
- Defined snapshot date.
- Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
- Example Results (first 10 customers):
    Customer 12346: Recency=326, Frequency=1, Monetary=77183.60
    Customer 12347: Recency=2, Frequency=7, Monetary=4310.00
    ...

Step 4: RFM Segmentation
------------------------
- Assigned R, F, M scores (1–5 scale).
- Concatenated scores into RFM_Score.
- Created segments like Champions, Loyal Customers, Lost Customers, At Risk, etc.
- Example Results (first 15 customers):
    Customer 12347: RFM_Score=555, Segment=Champions
    Customer 12358: RFM_Score=524, Segment=Loyal Customers
    Customer 12361: RFM_Score=111, Segment=Lost Customers
    ...

Step 5: Marketing Strategy by Segment
-------------------------------------
- Wrote actionable strategies for each segment:
  * Champions: Reward them, give early access to new products.
  * Loyal Customers: Provide loyalty programs, exclusive deals.
  * At Risk: Send personalized offers to re-engage them.
  * Lost Customers: Offer strong discounts or win-back campaigns.
  * Others: Nurture gradually with targeted promotions.

Step 6: Visualization of RFM Segments
-------------------------------------
- Created visualizations:
  * Bar chart: Count of customers per segment.
  * Summary table: Average RFM values per segment.
  * Heatmap: Compared Recency, Frequency, and Monetary across segments.

------------------------------------------------------------

Final Notes:
============
- All requirements of the project were covered step by step.
- We successfully performed customer segmentation using RFM Analysis.
- The analysis provided both business insights and actionable marketing strategies.
- Bonus visualizations were also included for clearer understanding of segments.
