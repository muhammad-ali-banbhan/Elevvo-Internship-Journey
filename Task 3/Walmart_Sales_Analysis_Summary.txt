# Sales Performance Analysis Project - Summary

## Objective
The main task was to analyze Walmart sales dataset and extract insights through data cleaning, trend analysis, and forecasting.

---
## Step 1: Data Loading & Inspection
- Dataset was loaded into Python using Pandas.
- Dataset contained multiple columns such as Store, Date, Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment.
- Verified number of rows and columns, checked for missing values and duplicates.

**Result:** Dataset was successfully imported and basic structure was understood.

---
## Step 2: Data Cleaning
- Converted the 'Date' column into proper datetime format.
- Extracted additional features: Month_Num, Year, and Week.
- Checked for and handled any missing/null values.

**Result:** Clean dataset prepared with new time-based features for analysis.

---
## Step 3: Sales Trend Over Time
- Grouped data by Date and aggregated Weekly_Sales.
- Plotted time series chart to observe fluctuations in sales.

**Result:** Clear pattern observed where sales spiked during November-December (holiday season). July months showed dips.

---
## Step 4: Holiday vs Non-Holiday Sales
- Grouped data by Holiday_Flag and compared average Weekly_Sales.
- Created bar chart for visualization.

**Result:** Holiday weeks showed significantly higher sales compared to normal weeks.

---
## Step 5: Monthly Sales Aggregation
- Grouped sales by Month_Num to see average monthly performance.
- Bar chart created.

**Result:** 
- Months 11 (November) and 12 (December) recorded peak sales.
- Months 7 (July) and 8 (August) recorded lowest sales.

---
## Step 6: Revenue by Store (Regional Proxy)
- Since product-level data was missing, used Store as proxy for region.
- Aggregated sales by Store.

**Result:** 
- Top 3 performing stores were Store 20, Store 4, and Store 14 with sales above 1.18e+08.
- Lowest performing store was Store 1 with sales around 9.13e+07.

---
## Step 7: Forecasting (Rolling Mean / Exponential Smoothing)
- Applied simple moving average and exponential smoothing to forecast future sales trends.
- Forecast line compared with actual sales.

**Result:**
- Forecast showed similar seasonal patterns, with predicted spikes around holiday seasons.
- Trend indicated overall stability with cyclical highs and lows.

---
## Insights from Visualizations
- **Blue Line:** Actual Sales – showed real demand spikes and drops.
- **Orange Line:** Moving Average – smoothed trend showing growth/decline phases.
- **Red Line:** Forecast – estimated future demand, closely following seasonal patterns.

---
## Final Notes
- Dataset size was large enough to capture clear patterns across multiple years.
- Data cleaning, feature extraction, and trend analysis were crucial steps.
- Holiday season is the biggest driver of sales, especially November–December.
- Certain stores consistently outperform others, highlighting regional differences.

This project successfully demonstrated the end-to-end data analysis pipeline: **Data Loading → Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Aggregation → Visualization → Forecasting.**
