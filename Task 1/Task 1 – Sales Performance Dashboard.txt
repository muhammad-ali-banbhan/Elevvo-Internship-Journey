   - Standardized data formatting (dates, currency, numbers).
   - Ensured categorical fields (Region, Product Category) were consistent.

3. Data Preparation:
   - Created calculated columns where necessary (e.g., revenue = sales × quantity).
   - Organized data into a structured format for pivot analysis.

4. Analysis with Pivot Tables:
   - Built pivot tables to summarize:

   - Added slicers to filter by region and product category for dynamic exploration.

6. Insights:
   - Identified monthly sales fluctuations (peaks and dips).
   - Clear visibility into which regions contributed the most.
   - Highlighted top-performing product categories.
   - Prepared data for further analysis (e.g., YoY or MoM comparisons).
